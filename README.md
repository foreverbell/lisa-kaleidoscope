## Introduction

Some funny thing powered by [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
implemented in different languages. As I learn one programming language by building some small,
funny but full-functional programs, this is a good example for me to get familiar with one
programming language, including basic syntax, programming model, asynchronous IO and e.t.c.

Imagine your have one hundred monkeys, and you give each of them a colorful pencil and paper. Your
monkeys are creatures that are brilliant at drawing circles! At each turn you ask every monkey to
draw a randomized filled circle on the paper. After that you compare their works with
[Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci)'s Mona Lisa, choose the best
among your monkeys' works including the last turn's best one, make one hundred hard-copys and let
your monkeys do again. Well.. do you think your monkeys will eventually draw you a Mona Lisa?

## Usage

Currently it is implemented in the following languages, I will add more if I am interest in other
languages.

* C++
* Golang
* Rust

```bash
$ cd $LANGUAGE
$ make run
```

Make sure you have the corresponding toolchain before you compile it.
