## Introduction

Some funny thing powered by [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
implemented in different languages. As I learn one programming language by building some small,
funny but full-functional program, this is a good example for me to get familiar with one
programming language, including basic syntax, programming model, asynchronous IO and e.t.c.

## Usage

Currently it is implemented in the following languages, I will add more if I am interest in other
languages.

* C++
* Golang
* Rust

```bash
$ cd $LANGUAGE
$ make run
```

Make sure you have the corresponding toolchain before you compile it.
